# Rock–Paper–Scissors

A simple and fun command-line version of the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game.  
You play against the computer, and the game supports “Best of N” rounds (like best of 3, 5, etc.).

This is a beginner-friendly Python project but still feels polished and interactive.

## How the Game Works
- Choose how many rounds you want to play (must be an odd number).
- Enter your move: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
- The computer randomly chooses a move.
- The winner is shown after every round.
- At the end, a final winner is announced.
